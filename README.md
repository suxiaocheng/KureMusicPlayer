## Credits

This project was built with a lot of help from the official Android
documentation and a lot of Google searches.

Firstly, the whole idea and basis came from [tutsplus]' awesome Android
articles. This project started because of [Sue Smith's][sue] tutorials on
[creating a Music Player on Android][part_one].

When I finished those, new features were added kinda impulsively. A huge
inspiration for project layout organization (and minor tweakings) came
from [k-9 mail] - an open-source mail client for Android. I use it everyday,
thanks a lot guys!

**Iron Maiden** - supporting me through the whole development. Best albums
ever - *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* and *Powerslave*.
